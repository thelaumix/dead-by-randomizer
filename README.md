# Dead by Randomizer
**The** shuffling tool for Dead by Daylight!

## Download
* Download it [directly from the DbR Homepage](https://dbr.thelaumix.com/app/)
* See [all releases](https://github.com/thelaumix/dead-by-randomizer/releases) on Github

## Randomization
DbR shuffles a full set of character and 4 perks to play. You can select your available DLCs to determine which characters are available to you.
Currently available perkname-languages are:
* English
* German

### Overlay
The Overlay *(which you also can disable)* shows you the current shuffle status and the result perk set even while you're ingame, as other notifications concerning DbR. You can even close the main window, DbR will keep running in the background, shuffling perks.

### Hotkeys
Especially while ingame and having the DbR-window closed or in background, it is comfortable to have a possibility to run the randomizer without leaving the game.

Current Hotkeys are:

Hotkey | Action
------------ | -------------
`Alt` + `Return` | Shuffle with current settings
`Alt` + `S` | *Shuffle survivor*
`Alt` + `K` | *Shuffle killer*


## Connecting to friends
You can add friends by their "Chi" *(**Ch**aracter **identifier**)*, a 4 digit code assigned randomly to each user.
When both sides accepted the invitation they are able to see who currently is online and explore their friends previous shuffled perksets.

If you don't want to get stalked too hard, there is an opportunity of hiding your last set from others. ;)

### DbR will receive functionality and performance - updates in the future!
